## Launch an app within a day at no cost
The main goal of the project is to be able launch a product in very little time, without compromising on scalability and quality.

### We achieve this is by doing the following:
- creating a mobile first Progressive Web App (PWA) to target many environments
- using lots of tools to advance the MVP as further as possible with the least amount of work:
  - react
  - material-ui and material-ui-icons
- automating as many things as possible: formatting, tests, and deploys
  - create-react-app
  - flow (needs more work)
  - prettier + standard
  - husky + lint-staged
- using services at a free tier level, where cost would only materialize if the product gets traction
  - CircleCi: CI & CD
  - codecov: code coverage
  - graphcool: Cloud Graphql Database
  - auth0: authentication
  - Firebase: hosting (open to suggestions)
  - Dependabot: automatic dependency updates
- establishing guidelines and templates:
  - issue templates
  - React templates
  - Commit guidelines
  - Branch guidelines


### Key Performance Measures:
- to **launch an MVP** as fast as possible: **within a day**
- to iterate on features quickly: **under 2 minute tests and deploys**
- to provide **tools for teams of up to 5 people**
- to support up to at least **10K active users per month**
- to be affordable for the hobbyist developer: **free until meaningful traction**

Reaching any of the limits should qualify you to raise enough funding to cover increased costs, or to pursue other endeavors to mitigate costs, or to request for free services for a non-profit.
